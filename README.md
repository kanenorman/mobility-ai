# MBTA Data Streaming and Prediction Project

## Project Introduction

As a regular user of the MBTA transit system during my time at Harvard, particularly relying on the red line at Harvard Station for quick commutes to MIT, I recognized the importance of accurate transit predictions. While the MBTA provides scheduled predictions, there is an opportunity to create our own real-time predictions. This project aims to encompass a comprehensive full-stack Machine Learning engineering workflow. From data engineering and machine learning to DevOps, MLOps, and web development, the project's goal is to develop a real-time streaming dashboard that predicts whether a transit line will arrive on time or experience delays.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of the MBTA Data Streaming and Prediction Project is to leverage data science and engineering to enhance transit prediction accuracy. By combining real-time data streaming and predictive modeling, we aim to create a system that provides users with valuable insights into transit timings. The project involves several key components:

1. **Real-Time Data Streaming**: Gathering real-time data from the MBTA transit system, including information on train schedules, delays, and historical performance.

2. **Data Engineering**: Processing and transforming the collected data to prepare it for use in predictive modeling.

3. **Predictive Modeling**: Developing machine learning models that analyze historical and real-time data to predict whether a transit line will be on time or experience delays.

4. **Real-Time Predicting**: Implementing a streaming pipeline that continuously updates predictions as new data arrives.

5. **Dashboard Development**: Creating a user-friendly web dashboard that displays real-time transit predictions and provides insights into transit line performance.

6. **DevOps and MLOps**: Establishing an effective DevOps workflow to automate deployment and monitoring of the streaming pipeline and models.
